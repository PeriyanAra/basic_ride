## üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps API Setup

This app uses the Google Maps SDK for displaying maps.

### üîë 1. Get an API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - **Maps SDK for Android**
   - **Maps SDK for iOS**
   - **Places API**
   - **Directions API**
   - **Geocoding API**
   - **Geolocation API**
   - **Distanse matrix API**
   - **Maps javascript API**
4. Navigate to **Credentials** and generate a new **API key**.
5. Restrict the key for Android/iOS usage as needed for security.

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Configure the API Key

### Android setup

* Navigate to the file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following code snippet inside the `application` tag:

   ```xml
   <!-- Add your Google Maps API Key here -->
   <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
                  android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
   ```

* Also, you will need location access in the app. So, add the following permission in the same file inside the `manifest` tag:
  
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
  ```

### iOS setup

* Navigate to the file `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` and replace the whole code with the following:

   ```swift
   import UIKit
   import Flutter
   import GoogleMaps
   
   @UIApplicationMain
   @objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
     override func application(
       _ application: UIApplication,
       didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
     ) -> Bool {
       //Add your Google Maps API Key here
       GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR KEY HERE")
       GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
       return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
     }
   }
   ```


* For getting location permission, add the following to the same file:
  
  ```
  <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
  <string>This app needs access to location when open.</string>
  ```
